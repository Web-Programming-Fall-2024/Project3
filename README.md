## Project Summary:

This project focuses on developing an interactive sliding puzzle game known as
the "Fifteen Puzzle." The game consists of a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles with one
missing tile, where players aim to arrange the tiles in numerical order. It features
user-friendly mechanics, visual feedback for movable tiles, and additional
functionalities such as shuffle, multiple backgrounds, and an end-of-game
notification to enhance player engagement.

## Key Features:

- **Homepage:**: Introduces the Fifteen Puzzle game, offering an interactive welcome
  animation. It briefly overviews the game rules and invites players to start playing.
- **Game Page:**: Hosts the puzzle grid and game controls. This page includes:
  Puzzle Grid: A 4x4 interactive grid displaying the tiles and blank space.
  ○ Shuffle Button: Randomizes the puzzle into a solvable state for a new
  game.
  ○ Settings Panel: Allows users to choose different background themes or
  adjust grid sizes.
- **End-of-Game Page:**: Notifies the user when they successfully solve the puzzle,
  showing elapsed time, the number of moves, and the best scores.

## Functionalities:

- **Interactive Puzzle**: Users can click on a tile adjacent to the blank space to move it into the
  empty position.
  ○ Hovering over a movable tile changes its style (border turns red, text
  underlined, text color changes to green).
- **Shuffle Feature:**: Randomizes the tiles into a solvable configuration using
  efficient algorithms.
- **End-of-Game Notification:**: Displays a celebratory message or animation when
  the puzzle is solved.
